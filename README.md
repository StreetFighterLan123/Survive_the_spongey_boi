# Survive_the_spongey_boi
===
This is a game where you try to survive spongebob trying to kill you! This game was inspired by a Roblox game my brother plays.
You control your player with the arrow keys, and your objective is to try to get as many coins
as you can while surviving! Spongebob will move at a slow speed at first, but every
5 coins you collect, he gets faster! How long can you survive?! Will you
win?

To win, you have to get to 25 coins. For now...
